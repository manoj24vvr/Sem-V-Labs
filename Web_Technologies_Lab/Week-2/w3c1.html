        <h2>About W3C</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web.</p>

    <h2 id="WD">Working Draft (WD)</h2>
    <p>After enough content has been gathered from 'editor drafts' and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community. A WD document is the first form of a standard that is publicly available. Commentary by virtually anyone is accepted, though no promises are made with regard to action on any particular element commented upon.<br><br>At this stage, the standard document may have significant differences from its final form. As such, anyone who implements WD standards should be ready to significantly modify their implementations as the standard matures.</p>

    <h2 id="CR">Candidate recommendation (CR)</h2>
    <p>A candidate recommendation is a version of a standard that is more mature than the WD. At this point, the group responsible for the standard is satisfied that the standard meets its goal. The purpose of the CR is to elicit aid from the development community as to how implementable the standard is.<br>The standard document may change further, but at this point, significant features are mostly decided. The design of those features can still change due to feedback from implementors</p>

    <h2 id="PR">Proposed recommendation (PR)</h2>
    <p>A proposed recommendation is the version of a standard that has passed the prior two levels. The users of the standard provide input. At this stage, the document is submitted to the W3C Advisory Council for final approval.<br><br>While this step is important, it rarely causes any significant changes to a standard as it passes to the next phase.</p>

    <h2 id="REC">W3C recommendation (REC)</h2>
    <p>This is the most mature stage of development. At this point, the standard has undergone extensive review and testing, under both theoretical and practical conditions. The standard is now endorsed by the W3C, indicating its readiness for deployment to the public, and encouraging more widespread support among implementors and authors.<br><br>Recommendations can sometimes be implemented incorrectly, partially, or not at all, but many standards define two or more levels of conformance that developers must follow if they wish to label their product as W3C-compliant.</p>

    <h3 id="mem">Membership</h3>
    <p>The Consortium is governed by its membership. The list of members is available to the public.Members include businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities, and individuals.<br><br>Membership requirements are transparent except for one requirement: An application for membership must be reviewed and approved by the W3C. Many guidelines and requirements are stated in detail, but there is no final guideline about the process or standards by which membership might be finally approved or denied.<br><br>The cost of membership is given on a sliding scale, depending on the character of the organization applying and the country in which it is located.[21] Countries are categorized by the World Bank's most recent grouping by GNI (gross national income) per capita.</p>
